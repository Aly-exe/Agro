    "loosesmutdes":"Wheat becomes unusually wet, resulting in squirrel swelling and distortion, causing significant crop losses to reduce the incidence of loose swelling, some preventive measures such as ensuring good pre-harvest dehydration of wheat, controlling insects and innate diseases, and avoiding storage in wet conditions.",

    "CrownRotsAndRoots":"Crown Rots & Root",
    "CrownRootdes":"The disease spreads to most farms immediately after the chilling, leading to the death of the infected seedlings, thus leading to a lack of production, especially if the time for planting a spasm is greater than that of the missing. The injury appears on some branches or on the entire plant, and is similar to the symptoms of water shortage",
    "CrownRootmed":"'''Rezolx''' is used as an effective treatment to eliminate mold and is sprayed in soil every four weeks if the rot is severe and every six weeks if the rot is simple. The treatment must be sprayed in the evening where no sunshine reacts to chemicals and negatively affects the soil. Soil moisture must be checked periodically, especially before chemical treatments are sprayed", 
    "leafrustdes":"The most common echo disease in wheat. Symptoms depend on plant sensitivity and injury. The incidence is characterized by the appearance of many small red orange pulses into a brown bull spread over the surface of the leaves, and by the perfume of the leaf and the crust. It's up to 1.5 mm in diameter, slightly high and round to rectangular shape.",
